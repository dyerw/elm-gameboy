# Elm GameBoy

Because why the hell not?

The purpose of this emulator is not to be performant or to replace
existing emulators people use to actually play GameBoy games but
to explore emulation semantics in a strongly typed functional language.
So yes, our bytes take up about 70 bytes of actual memory, but they're
type safe! So take that C++.
